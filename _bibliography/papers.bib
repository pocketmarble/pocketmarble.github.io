               surfactants for droplet microfluidics. The range of applications
               of droplet microfluidics has greatly expanded during the last
               decade thanks to its ability to manipulate and process tiny
               amount of sample and reagents at high throughput in independent
               reactors. A critical component of the technology is the
               formulation of the immiscible oil phase that contains
               surfactants to stabilize droplets. The success of droplet
               microfluidics relies mostly on a single fluorinated formulation
               that uses a PFPE-PEG tri-block surfactant. The synthesis of this
               surfactant is laborious and requires skills in synthetic
               chemistry preventing the wider community to explore the
               synthesis of alternate surfactants. We sought to provide a
               simplified synthesis for novel PFPE-PEG surfactants based on
               click chemistry approaches such as copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne
               cycloaddition (CuAAC) and UV-activated thiol-yne reactions. Our
               strategy is based on converting a moisture sensitive
               intermediate typically used in the synthesis of the tri-block
               PFPE-PEG surfactant into a stable and click ready molecule. We
               successfully combined that fluorinated tail with differently
               functionalized PEG and glycerol ethoxylate molecules to generate
               surfactants with diverse structures via CuACC and thiol-yne
               reactions. We report the characterization, biocompatibility and
               ability to stabilize emulsions of those surfactants, as well as
               the unique advantages and challenges of the strategy.",

  abstract  = "High levels of H2A.Z promote melanoma cell proliferation and
               correlate with poor prognosis. However, the role of the two
               distinct H2A.Z histone chaperone complexes SRCAP and P400-TIP60
               in melanoma remains unclear. Here, we show that individual
               subunit depletion of SRCAP, P400, and VPS72 (YL1) results in not
               only the loss of H2A.Z deposition into chromatin but also a
               reduction of H4 acetylation in melanoma cells. This loss of H4
               acetylation is particularly found at the promoters of cell cycle
               genes directly bound by H2A.Z and its chaperones, suggesting a
               coordinated regulation between H2A.Z deposition and H4
               acetylation to promote their expression. Knockdown of each of
               the three subunits downregulates E2F1 and its targets, resulting
               in a cell cycle arrest akin to H2A.Z depletion. However, unlike
               H2A.Z deficiency, loss of the shared H2A.Z chaperone subunit YL1
               induces apoptosis. Furthermore, YL1 is overexpressed in melanoma
               tissues, and its upregulation is associated with poor patient
               outcome. Together, these findings provide a rationale for future

  abstract = "AbstractEarly, high-resolution metrics are needed to ascertain
              the immune response to vaccinations. The T cell receptor (TCR), a
              heterodimer of one $\alpha$ and one $\beta$ chain, is a promising
              target, with the complete TCR repertoire reflecting the T cells
              present in an individual. To this end, we developed Tseek, an
              unbiased and accurate method for profiling the TCR repertoire by
              sequencing the TCR $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains and developing a
              suite of tools for repertoire analysis. An added advantage is the
              ability to non-invasively analyze T cells in peripheral blood
              mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Tseek and the analytical suite were
              used to explore the T cell response to both the COVID-19 mRNA
              vaccine (n=9) and the seasonal inactivated Influenza vaccine
              (n=5) at several time points. Neutralizing antibody titers were
              also measured in the covid vaccine samples. The COVID-19 vaccine
              elicited a broad T cell response involving multiple expanded
              clones, whereas the Influenza vaccine elicited a narrower
              response involving fewer clones. Many distinct T cell clones
              responded at each time point, over a month, providing temporal
              details lacking in the antibody measurements, especially before
              the antibodies are detectable. In individuals recovered from a
              SARS-CoV-2 infection, the first vaccine dose elicited a robust T
              cell response, while the second dose elicited a comparatively
              weaker response, indicating a saturation of the response. The
              physical symptoms experienced by the recipients immediately
              following the vaccinations were not indicative of the
              TCR/antibody responses. The TCR responses broadly presaged the
              antibody responses. We also found that the TCR repertoire acts as
              an individual fingerprint: donors of blood samples taken years
              apart could be identified solely based upon their TCR repertoire,
              hinting at other surprising uses the TCR repertoire may have.
              These results demonstrate the promise of TCR repertoire
              sequencing as an early and sensitive measure of the adaptive
              immune response to vaccination, which can help improve immunogen
              selection and optimize vaccine dosage and spacing between doses.",
